# UMBS Fine root function response to girdling disturbance

## Authors 

Kayla C. Mathes, Christopher M. Gough 

## Project Description 
Assessing fine-root physiological response to experimental tree girdling to better understand mechanisms underlying belowground compensatory growth and carbon cycling responses to forest disturbance. 

## Location 
TBD

## Study Design 

## R scripts 

Pre-treatment Data analysis:
**"Soil_Respiration.R"**: bulk Soil respiration, soil temperature and moisture for both treatment and control plots. 
**"Stemmapping.R"**: Stem map of all canopy and subcanopy trees within the treatment and control plots.
