# UMBS Biotron Project

## Authors 

Kayla C. Mathes, Christopher M. Gough 

### Project Description 
Assessing fine-root physiological response to experimental tree girdling to better understand mechanisms underlying belowground compensatory growth and carbon cycling responses to forest disturbance. 

### Location 
The "Biotron" at the University of Michigan Biological Station, Pellston, MI, USA. The biotron is a 30m root window tunnel with direct access to root systems of a Northern temperate forest. 

### Study Design 

## R scripts 

Pre-treatment Data analysis:
*"Soil_Respiration.R"*: bulk Soil respiration, soil temperature and moisture for both treatment and control plots. 
*"Stemmapping.R"*: Stem map of all canopy and subcanopy trees within the treatment and control plots.
